# Glossary

Terminology used throughout the AI Psychiatrist codebase and documentation.

---

## Clinical Terms

### PHQ-8 (Patient Health Questionnaire-8)

An 8-item self-report depression screening tool derived from the PHQ-9 (which includes a suicide ideation question). Each item assesses the frequency of a depressive symptom over the past two weeks on a 0-3 scale.

**Items:**
1. **NoInterest** (Anhedonia): Little interest or pleasure in doing things
2. **Depressed**: Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless
3. **Sleep**: Trouble falling/staying asleep, or sleeping too much
4. **Tired**: Feeling tired or having little energy
5. **Appetite**: Poor appetite or overeating
6. **Failure**: Feeling bad about yourself — or that you are a failure
7. **Concentrating**: Trouble concentrating on things
8. **Moving**: Moving or speaking slowly, or being fidgety/restless

**Scoring:**
- 0 = Not at all
- 1 = Several days
- 2 = More than half the days
- 3 = Nearly every day

### MDD (Major Depressive Disorder)

A clinical diagnosis based on DSM-5 criteria. In the PHQ-8 context, a total score ≥ 10 indicates likely MDD.

### Severity Levels

Depression severity categories derived from PHQ-8 total scores:

| Level | Score Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| MINIMAL | 0-4 | No significant symptoms |
| MILD | 5-9 | Mild depressive symptoms |
| MODERATE | 10-14 | Moderate symptoms (MDD threshold) |
| MOD_SEVERE | 15-19 | Moderately severe symptoms |
| SEVERE | 20-24 | Severe depressive symptoms |

### DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition)

The standard classification system for mental disorders used by mental health professionals. PHQ-8 items align with DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Episode.

### N/A Score

When the model cannot determine a PHQ-8 item score due to insufficient evidence in the transcript. N/A scores contribute 0 to the total score.

## Dataset Terms

### DAIC-WOZ (Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard of Oz)

A multimodal dataset of clinical interviews for depression detection research. Contains 189 participants with semi-structured interviews conducted by an animated virtual interviewer named Ellie.

**Key facts:**
- Requires EULA from USC ICT for access
- 142 labeled participants (train + dev), 47 unlabeled (test)
- Participant IDs range 300-492 (with gaps)
- Interview duration: 5-25 minutes

### AVEC (Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge)

Annual challenge series for affective computing research. DAIC-WOZ was used in AVEC 2016-2019 challenges.

### Ellie

The animated virtual interviewer character in DAIC-WOZ. Controlled via Wizard-of-Oz protocol (human operator behind the scenes).

### Participant

An individual who completed a DAIC-WOZ interview. Identified by a numeric ID (e.g., 300, 301, 402).

## System Terms

### Agent

A specialized LLM-powered component that performs a specific task in the pipeline. AI Psychiatrist uses four agents:

1. **Qualitative Assessment Agent**: Analyzes social, biological, and risk factors
2. **Judge Agent**: Evaluates qualitative assessment quality
3. **Quantitative Assessment Agent**: Predicts PHQ-8 item scores
4. **Meta-Review Agent**: Integrates all assessments into final severity

### Feedback Loop

Iterative refinement process where the Judge Agent evaluates the Qualitative Agent's output and triggers re-generation if any metric scores ≤ 3 (out of 5). Runs up to 10 iterations per the paper.

### Evaluation Metrics

Four metrics used by the Judge Agent to evaluate qualitative assessments (1-5 Likert scale):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Coherence** | Logical consistency of the assessment |
| **Completeness** | Coverage of all relevant symptoms and frequencies |
| **Specificity** | Avoidance of vague or generic statements |
| **Accuracy** | Alignment with PHQ-8/DSM-5 criteria |

### Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot

**Zero-shot**: The LLM receives only the transcript and prompt, with no reference examples.

**Few-shot**: The LLM receives similar transcript chunks from a reference database along with their known PHQ-8 scores. Achieves 22% lower MAE than zero-shot (0.619 vs 0.796).

### Embeddings

Vector representations of transcript chunks used for similarity search in few-shot retrieval. Generated by qwen3-embedding:8b model (4096 dimensions).

### Reference Store

Pre-computed database of embeddings from training set transcripts with known PHQ-8 scores. Used to find similar examples for few-shot prompting.

### Chunk

A segment of transcript text used for embedding generation. Paper-optimal: 8 lines with 2-line sliding window step.

## Architecture Terms

### Clean Architecture

Software design pattern with concentric layers:
- **Domain**: Business entities and logic (innermost)
- **Use Cases/Services**: Application-specific business rules
- **Adapters**: Interface implementations (API, CLI)
- **Infrastructure**: External concerns (LLM, database, logging)

### Protocol

Python typing construct (similar to interface) defining expected methods. Used for dependency injection and testability.

### Entity

Mutable domain object with identity (UUID). Examples: `Transcript`, `PHQ8Assessment`, `MetaReview`.

### Value Object

Immutable domain object without identity. Equal if all attributes equal. Examples: `ItemAssessment`, `EvaluationScore`, `SimilarityMatch`.

---

## Configuration Terms

### Ollama

Open-source platform for running LLMs locally. Used as the LLM backend for AI Psychiatrist.

### Model Tags

Ollama model identifiers in format `name:variant`:
- `gemma3:27b` - Gemma 3 27B (paper baseline)
- `alibayram/medgemma:27b` - MedGemma 27B (18% better quantitative MAE)
- `qwen3-embedding:8b` - Qwen 3 8B embedding model

### Pydantic Settings

Configuration management using Pydantic. Settings are loaded from:
1. Default values in code
2. `.env` file
3. Environment variables (highest priority)

---

## Metric Terms

### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Average absolute difference between predicted and actual PHQ-8 item scores. Lower is better.

**Paper results:**
- Zero-shot: 0.796 MAE
- Few-shot: 0.619 MAE (22% improvement)
- MedGemma few-shot: 0.505 MAE (18% improvement over Gemma)

### Accuracy

Percentage of correct severity level predictions.

**Paper results:**
- Meta-Review: 78% severity accuracy
- Comparable to human expert performance

### Likert Scale

Rating scale used for Judge Agent metrics. 1-5 scale where:
- 1-2 = Poor
- 3 = Marginal
- 4-5 = Acceptable

---

## File Format Terms

### TSV (Tab-Separated Values)

Text file format using tabs as delimiters. DAIC-WOZ transcripts use TSV format.

### NPZ (NumPy Compressed Archive)

Binary format for storing multiple NumPy arrays. Used for pre-computed reference embeddings.

### JSON Sidecar

Companion JSON file containing metadata for binary files (e.g., `reference_embeddings.json` accompanies `reference_embeddings.npz`).
