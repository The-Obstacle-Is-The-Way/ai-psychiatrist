# PHQ-8 Domain Keywords for Evidence Extraction
#
# CLINICALLY VALIDATED & SUBSTRING-SAFE VERSION (2025-12-21)
# Review: Kroenke et al., 2009 (PHQ-8 Definitions)
#
# These keywords are used for keyword backfill when LLM extraction
# misses relevant sentences in interview transcripts.
#
# Paper Reference: Section 2.3.2 (Quantitative Assessment)
#
# SAFETY PROTOCOLS APPLIED:
# 1. Collision Proofing: Removed single-word tokens that exist inside common words.
#    - "tired" removed (matches "reTIRED", "atTIRED")
#    - "numb" removed (matches "NUMBer")
#    - "nap" removed (matches "sNAP", "kidNAP")
#    - "napping" removed (matches "sNAPPING")
#    - "reading" removed (matches "dREADING", "spREADING")
#    - "blue" removed (matches "BLUEprint", "BLUEjeans")
#    - "sad" removed (matches "SADly")
#    - "bored" removed (matches "laBORED", "harBORED")
#    - "loser" removed (matches "cLOSER")
#    - "failure" removed (matches "heart FAILURE" - semantic)
#    - "burden" removed (matches "burdensome" without self-reference)
#    - "fault" removed (matches "deFAULT")
#    - "stuck" removed (matches "STUCK in traffic")
#    - "binge" removed (matches "BINGE watch")
#    - "starving" removed (hyperbolic: "I'm STARVING")
#
# 2. Domain Specificity: Keywords require symptom context, not bare nouns.
#
# FORMAT:
# - All keywords are matched case-insensitively via substring matching.
# - Apostrophe and no-apostrophe variants included for robustness.
# - Keywords are loaded as a packaged resource so they work in installed wheels.
#
# FUTURE IMPROVEMENT (see GitHub issue):
# - Word-boundary regex matching would allow safe use of single tokens.
# - Negation window detection would filter "I'm NOT depressed".
