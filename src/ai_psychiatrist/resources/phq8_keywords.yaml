# PHQ-8 Domain Keywords for Evidence Extraction
#
# CLINICALLY VALIDATED & SUBSTRING-SAFE VERSION (2025-12-21)
# Review: Kroenke et al., 2009 (PHQ-8 Definitions)
#
# These keywords are used for keyword backfill when LLM extraction
# misses relevant sentences in interview transcripts.
#
# Paper Reference: Section 2.3.2 (Quantitative Assessment)
#
# SAFETY PROTOCOLS APPLIED:
# 1. Collision Proofing: Removed single-word tokens that exist inside common words.
#    - "tired" removed (matches "reTIRED", "atTIRED")
#    - "numb" removed (matches "NUMBer")
#    - "nap" removed (matches "sNAP", "kidNAP")
#    - "napping" removed (matches "sNAPPING")
#    - "napping a lot" removed (matches "sNAPPING a lot")
#    - "reading" removed (matches "dREADING", "spREADING")
#    - "blue" removed (matches "BLUEprint", "BLUEjeans")
#    - "sad" removed (matches "SADly")
#    - "bored" removed (matches "laBORED", "harBORED")
#    - "loser" removed (matches "cLOSER")
#    - "failure" removed (matches "heart FAILURE" - semantic)
#    - "burden" removed (matches "burdensome" without self-reference)
#    - "fault" removed (matches "deFAULT")
#    - "stuck" removed (matches "STUCK in traffic")
#    - "binge" removed (matches "BINGE watch")
#    - "starving" removed (hyperbolic: "I'm STARVING")
#    - "fatigue" removed (matches "FATIGUES" - Veteran uniform context)
#    - "foggy" removed (matches "FOGGY morning")
#    - "comfort food" removed (ambiguous, not necessarily overeating)
#
# 2. Cross-Domain Collision Protections:
#    - "pacing" removed (matches inside "sPACING out" -> would flag Agitation for Concentration)
#    - "restless" removed (matches inside "RESTLESS sleep" -> would flag Agitation for Sleep)
#    - "scattered" removed (matches "SCATTERED papers" -> Environmental vs Cognitive)
#    - "wake up early" removed (matches healthy "I wake up early for work")
#    - "sluggish" removed from Item 8 (kept in Item 4 only to avoid domain bleed)
#
# 3. "eating X" Substring Collisions (crEATING less/too much):
#    - "eating less" removed (matches "crEATING less stress")
#    - "eating too much" removed (matches "crEATING too much work")
#    - "eating more than usual" removed (matches "crEATING more than usual")
#    - "eating less than usual" removed (matches "crEATING less than usual")
#    - Replaced with first-person anchored variants: "i'm eating less", "been eating less", etc.
#
# 4. Clinical Domain Purity (PHQ-8 Item 8 Psychomotor):
#    - "jumpy" removed (PTSD/hyperarousal, not psychomotor retardation/agitation)
#    - "feel stuck" removed (life circumstances, not observable psychomotor change)
#    - "on edge" removed (anxiety/hyperarousal, not psychomotor)
#
# 5. Domain Specificity: Keywords require symptom context, not bare nouns.
#
# 6. Additional Substring Anchor Safety (swEAT/reTIRED fixes):
#    - "eat less" removed (matches "swEAT LESS")
#    - "eat too much" removed (matches "swEAT TOO MUCH")
#    - "tired easily" removed (matches "reTIRED EASILY" - Veteran dataset)
#    - "over eat" (with space) removed (matches "lOVER EATer")
#    - Retained safe forms: "get tired easily", "overeat" (no space), anchored variants.
#
# FORMAT:
# - All keywords are matched case-insensitively via substring matching.
# - Apostrophe and no-apostrophe variants included for robustness.
# - Keywords are loaded as a packaged resource so they work in installed wheels.
#
# FUTURE IMPROVEMENT (see GitHub issue):
# - Word-boundary regex matching would allow safe use of single tokens.
# - Negation window detection would filter "I'm NOT depressed".
