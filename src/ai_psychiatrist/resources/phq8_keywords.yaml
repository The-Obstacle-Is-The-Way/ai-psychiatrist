# PHQ-8 Domain Keywords for Evidence Extraction
#
# CLINICALLY VALIDATED VERSION (2025-12-21)
# Review: Kroenke et al., 2009 (PHQ-8 Definitions)
#
# These keywords are used for keyword backfill when LLM extraction
# misses relevant sentences in interview transcripts.
#
# Paper Reference: Section 2.3.2 (Quantitative Assessment)
#
# Format: Each PHQ-8 item maps to a list of keywords/phrases that
# indicate potential symptom evidence in the transcript.
#
# Notes:
# - All keywords are matched case-insensitively (substring match).
# - Include both apostrophe and no-apostrophe variants where common.
# - High-risk generic words (e.g., "eat", "low", "sleep") have been REMOVED
#   to prevent substring collisions (e.g., "grEAT", "sLOW", "aSLEEP").
# - Keywords are loaded as a packaged resource so they work in installed wheels.
