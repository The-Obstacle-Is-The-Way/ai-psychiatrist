# PHQ-8 Domain Keywords for Evidence Extraction
#
# These keywords are used for keyword backfill when LLM extraction
# misses relevant sentences in interview transcripts.
#
# Paper Reference: Section 2.3.2 (Quantitative Assessment)
#
# Format: Each PHQ-8 item maps to a list of keywords/phrases that
# indicate potential symptom evidence in the transcript.
#
# Notes:
# - All keywords are matched case-insensitively.
# - Keywords are loaded as a packaged resource so they work in installed wheels.
